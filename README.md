# Analytics vidhya JOB-A-THON - September 2021

## Introduction
The objective of this JOB-A-THON is to predict future daily sales by Store based on some explanatory features. We were provided with 516 days historical sales along with some explanatory features for 365 stores. Our aim is to predict next 61 days sales for all 365 stores with optimized MSLE score.

## Data preprocessing

New features has been generated based on Date features. Details are given in next section.

## Target & Feature information
Below are the feature information and respective transformation used during modeling:

 + Target : Sales (Since sales variable is skewed, **sqrt** transformation is performed for training purpose.)
 + Features :
     
     1. Store_id : Indicator variable. Used as is in the model. In addition to Store_id, one additional feature is also created based on target encoding. This feature is created by taking average of sqrt(Sales) by each store_id. This feature is merged with train and test data based on Store_id. This features help us to understand size of each store.
     2. Discount : Binary feature. Recoded into 1 and 0.
     3. Store_Type : Categorical feature. Performed Dummy Encoding(One-hot) Encoding.
     4. Location_Type : Categorical feature. Performed Dummy Encoding(One-hot) Encoding.
     5. Region_Code : Categorical feature. Performed Dummy Encoding(One-hot) Encoding.
     6. Holiday : Binary feature. Recoded into 1 and 0.
     7. Date : Date indicator. Based on this, new features has been created to understand time related pattern. These are Year, Month, Day, Week_of_year, Day_of_week, Weekend, Month_Start, Month_End, Quarter_Start, Quarter_End, Year_Start, Year_End. This date features are used as is in the model except Day_of_week feature. It is converted using One-hot encoding. 

## Exploratory data analysis

Detailed EDA has been conducted on this dataset. Below are the some major findings are :

 + Sales is not following normal distribution. It is right skewed with heavy tail influenced by presence of high sales in some stores or day.
 + Zero Sales were recorded in some instances.
 + Discount, Holiday and Store_Type are having major impact on Sales.
 + High Sales were observed during Weekend compare to weekdays.
 + There are fluctuations in store level average sales. Some stores are showing abnormally high sales.
 
## Model training

At first, historical training dataset is devided into two parts : train and val. This splitting is done based on time driven split. Last two month dataset kept for validation and rest all are kept as training set. Various model has been explored and tested using this dataset. Some of these are :

 1. Random Forest model
 2. XGBoost model
 3. Prophet model by individual stores.

> **Random Forest** model is found as best performing model. This model is again retrained on whole training set with below parameters:

**Target** : $\sqrt{Sales}$

**Features** : Store_id, Holiday, Discount, Year, Month, Day, Week_of_year, Weekend, Month_Start, Month_End, Quarter_Start,
               Quarter_End, Year_Start, Year_End, Store_Type_S1, Store_Type_S2, Store_Type_S3, Store_Type_S4, Location_Type_L1,
               Location_Type_L2, Location_Type_L3, Location_Type_L4, Location_Type_L5, Region_Code_R1, Region_Code_R2,
               Region_Code_R3, Region_Code_R4, Day_of_week_0, Day_of_week_1, Day_of_week_2, Day_of_week_3, Day_of_week_4, Day_of_week_5,
               Day_of_week_6, Avg_Sales_Sqrt
               
 **Hyperparameters**  :      
   + n_estimators : 500
   + min_samples_leaf : 3
   + max_features : sqrt
   + n_jobs : -1
   + random_state: 123
 
## Next steps

Exploring additional features like lag features, rolling average features can improve model quality. In addition to this. Neural network algorithms like LSTM can also improve model quality.
